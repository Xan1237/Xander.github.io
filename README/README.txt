Code descriptions:
I reused some html from the previous assignment although a lot of the formatting is deffrent due to the allowence od css.

The navigation menu is consistent across all pages and consists of a flexbox layout with three elements in it that all link to 
three individual pages of the website. The first page is the hompage which is also comprised of a grid layout. It contains an image of myself
as a header. Underneeth this image there are two more columns of information. An about me section and a language experience.
The about me is simply a paragraph explaining some basic informartion. The language experience is a list of
programming languages I have some experience in. Finally at the end of this page and all pages on the site there is a 
footer that includes mailto and telephone links to contact me. This footer is styled with a flexbox layout.
Another page on the site is the personal information page. This page includes three picturesof three diffrent sports I play with three paragraphs 
underneeth the images. This page is styled with a grid layout for the body with the flexbox header and footer.
The final page on the website is the professional information page. This page is formated with grid areas and contains a personal 
project and achedemic achevments. The main focus of the page is the personal website so that is very big and full screen width when 
the page is oppen. Finally the css document is devided into three sections using comments. These sections are generally for every
individual website. Although there are some areas especially regarding the header and footer where the css tags are reused from diffrent
sections from the css code.
